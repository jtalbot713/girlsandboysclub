<body>Career Mentoring program
The Career Mentoring program is a career exploration and mentoring program for teens (age 14-18). We partner Club members with volunteers in various careers, so that the members can experience the professional workplace and explore the possibilities that await after graduating high school.

We currently have mentoring opportunities in retail management, advertising, engineering, social work, nursing, and criminal justice. And if any Club members express interest in a specific career, we will work hard to find a local mentor in that field.
